ðŸ“Œ Overview

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Accurately detects the user's time zone based on IP location
<br />
âœ… Maps IANA time zones to Windows time zone names (prevents tzutil errors)
<br />
âœ… Applies the correct time zone and syncs system time
<br />
âœ… Works across Windows, macOS, and Fedora Linux
<br />

<br />

ðŸ›  Supported Platforms
Windows (10, 11, Server 2016+)
macOS (Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura)
Linux (Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu with timedatectl)

ðŸ“œ How It Works
Detects the systemâ€™s public IP-based time zone using http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip
Maps the IANA timezone format (e.g., America/New_York) to Windows time zones (e.g., Eastern Standard Time)
Applies the correct time zone if different from the current system setting
Ensures time synchronization is enabled to keep the clock accurate
