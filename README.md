ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Chef cookbook automatically detects and applies the correct time zone on a system. It works across Windows, macOS, and Linux (Fedora) by using network-based detection and ensuring the system time is accurate.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Accurately detects the user's time zone based on IP location
âœ… Maps IANA time zones to Windows time zone names (prevents tzutil errors)
âœ… Applies the correct time zone and syncs system time
âœ… Works across Windows, macOS, and Fedora Linux
âœ… No external API keys required

ðŸ›  Supported Platforms
Windows (10, 11, Server 2016+)
macOS (Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura)
Linux (Fedora, RHEL, Ubuntu with timedatectl)

ðŸ“œ How It Works
Detects the systemâ€™s public IP-based time zone using http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip
Maps the IANA timezone format (e.g., America/New_York) to Windows time zones (e.g., Eastern Standard Time)
Applies the correct time zone if different from the current system setting
Ensures time synchronization is enabled to keep the clock accurate
